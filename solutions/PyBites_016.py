"""
PyBites 16. PyBites date generator â˜†
Write a generator that returns special dates for PyBites:

Every year mark counting from PYBITES_BORN date (so 19th of Dec 2017, 19th of Dec 2018, etc)
Every 100 days mark counting from PYBITES_BORN (29th of March 2017, 7th of July 2017, etc)
See the tests for more details how your code will be tested: as this is a beginner's challenge we only calculate a few years ahead,
leaving the next leap year (2020) out of this challenge.
